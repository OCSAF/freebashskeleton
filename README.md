# freebashskeleton

With this script skeleton you can quickly create your own scripts with your own parameters using getopts. The skeleton also serves to unify the FreeOCSAF Bash scripts and make them easier to understand.

In addition, the integration of activatable font colors for marking the script output is already integrated as a function library.

Special thanks to the open source community for many useful ideas that made the creation of this script skeleton possible! 
Further ideas and suggestions for improvement are very welcome.
